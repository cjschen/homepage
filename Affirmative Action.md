I know this is at the top of my blog, but given the subject of this blog post, I want to reitterate this is my personal experience and one anecdote of many. It's not a reflection of my company or CodeNation and I certainly don't want it to be used as fodder for either side of the argument. 

I'm also not a hiring manager (as of Oct 2021) and have not recieved a lot of diversity training in general and none through work.

I did tell the people at CodeNation this in the screening phone call and I was still allowed to volunteer, so this take can't be that hot.

## Diversity and Me Today 

Diversity is important to me. I'm a part of the women's engineering organization at work and I volunteer at Code Nation, a non profit that offers students in under-resourced high schools coding lessons with volunteers in the industry. Their mission is to breaks deep-seated social and economic inequities in the tech industry by giving these students tools to propel them into tech careers.

I don't think being a woman has ever affect my day to day job. I know women who've been maligned and dismissed in their roles but that luckily hasn't happened to me. I am respected where I work and some of the best engineers at my organization are woman. 

However my gender definitely colours my experiences.

At one internship I've had a boss tell me "Oh it's okay because you're a woman". At my first internship away from my family I didn't fit in with the other interns, partially because I was a girl, In hindsight, I was very lonely and it greatly affected my mental health. At yet another internship, I had a fellow intern ask me about what I thought about affirmative action, or what I would do if I was the diversity hire. He was just curious about my persective I didn't mind answering his questions at the time, but in hindsight, it felt like I had to speak for and defend my entire gender.

I've had a coworker casually talk about how the sole girl in his college class would use her beauty to entrap her thirsty classmates and pick project partners what would do all her work for her; like an academic femme fatale (my words, not his). It really upset me as a woman who deals with imposter syndrome and was always wondering if I'm not pulling a weight. I pulled him into a room afterwards and he laughed about my concerns which was a nice conficence boost at least.

For the majority of my career, I've been the only female engineer on my team. A friend told me an anecdote about how she was specifically pulled into an interview for another team to showcase diversity, that they were looking to hire a woman to increase diversity on their team, but that that woman ultimately turned the oppertunity down because she didn't think the team was diverse enough.

But this story takes place before any of that and it's a story about how good intentions to encourage women to do CS, hurt me greatly.

## In my Senior Year of High School

It was my senior year of high school and I'd already made my mind up, so I joined a club which practiced computer science problems after school largely in preperation for two competitions, the CCC and the ECCO. 

I was _very_ competitive about math competitions. My parents sent me to special classes to prepare for them and it could help with university admissions so I took these just as seriously. 

The Candian Computer Competion (CCC) was an individual contest but the Educational Computing Organization of Ontario (ECOO) Contest, however was done in teams of four, so my teachers decided to form teams based on CCC results to give the top team the best chance of doing well. Each school could send two teams of mixed gender, and to promote they could send one additional team of all girls.

When results came back, I got fourth in the school, thus theoretically nabbing me a place on the top team, but there were more than 8 boys who wanted to go.

So my teachers, one of them female, pulled me aside and told me I was going to be on the all girls team instead. I thought it was going to be okay. After all, three out of nine students in my senior year CS class were girls and I had a friend a year younger also passionate about CS. We were all familiar and I secretly thought one of the boys on the main team was a stuck up jerk anyway.

But the other girls didn't wanted to go. In the end, all my teachers could scrounge up were three freshmen from the Introduction to CS course who had barely learned to code a month or two ago. They would've barely known what loops were, if at all.

I remember is being angry, crying and being distraught, the angries and most distraught I've been as a teenager. I don't rember if I yelled or raised my voice when I told my teacher how unfair this was, but I'm not proud of the way I acted. I would not act that way today. I don't remember apologizing. I'd like to think I did, but if you're reading this, Ms Xie, I'm sorry.

In the end, it turns out one of the results for another boy was entered incorrectedly, bumping me down to fifth. He definitely deseved that spot more than me and I was suprised he didn't score higher than me in the first place. One of the on the secondary team couldn't go so I ended up on the team I was supposed to be on in the end.

I probably would've boycotted altogether if I hadn't been allowed on the mixed-gender team and I did think about boycotting anyway.

I don't think the ECOO constest organizers are wrong to make the rules they did, but I wouldn't be suprised if the move ultimately hurt women more than heled. From what I can tell, the all girls teams always underperformed compared to the "mixed-gender" ones and the awards they gave out to the top female teams were largely a joke. I did write them a very strongly worded email, laying out the same experience and arguments I did here, but I never heard back. I checked back and the 2021 and 2020 competitions were individual and online due to the pandemic, so I don't know if they still have the same rules.

I also don't think my teachers were wrong to try to offer the oppertunity to as many deserving kids as possible and I don't resent them for their decisions anymore. Their positive impact on my life by teaching me computer science is immeasurable and I am grateful for that.

But it did make me feel awful. 

I'm still working through those feelings today and it's made me leery of blind quotas ever since.

## Final Thoughts

I've complained a lot in this post without offering a good solution. I know as the daughter of two highly educated and supportive asian parents, I'm already immensely priviliged in the first place.

Like many systemic problems, there needs to be hard and gradual systemic change. It's not as easy as setting quotas or trying to recruit more diverse candidates, although those methods can be a good start. I don't think we can solve inequity without more direct methods like those, but I also think lazy solutions can harm more than help. 

My experience was very discouraging, and I think there's a version of me out there who quit CS because of it and became an accountant instead.

https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding This NPR podcast talks about how the number of women studying computer science used to faster than the number of men, after all women like Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper pioneered the science. Yet that stopped when the home computer grew popular and professors started assuming students had prior experience. Women were behind their male peers who grew up playing computer games which are still largely marketed towards boys today. 

I've talked largely about female representation in this blog post, but this gap doesn't just exist for gender. Kids who grew up with parents who are computer scientists, in wealthy neighborhoods where everyone has internet access and a computer are at an immense advantage compared to kids who grew up without. 

I got a leg up because I went to a good high school with a computer science program. I grew up with legos and hot wheels as well as barbie dolls. My experience in high school, although awful, was a privilege. One of my friends didn't get the same sort of education I did and she did so poorly in her first year classes she considered dropping her degree for Geomatics. I'm glad she didn't because she's an immensely talented engineer who's gotten promotion after promotion. Yet how many people like her dropped just because I started out a little ahead? 

I want to be a good engineer so that one day, I can inspire a young intern to continue on her path, the same way working with excellent female engineers inspired me.

I volunteer with Code Nation, where in the two classes I've had, I've been the only female volunteer and only one of color. So I can give others the same opportunity I had and show them that not all of those in the profession are white or male.

If you work in Chicago, New York or the Bay Area and are a Software Professional, Codenation is always looking for more volunteers! (link here)

Change isn't immediate. It's a long road to equality. This is how I make my difference.
